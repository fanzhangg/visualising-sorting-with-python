# Visualising Sorting with Python

![](cover.png)

This resource is designed as a classroom-based activity to teach students about the methodology of some popular sorting algorithms, along with their complexity and performance. Students use Matplotlib to visualise the sorting algorithms as they run, giving them a greater understanding of the algorithm's method and performance.
